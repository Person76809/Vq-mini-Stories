      <h1>Blood hungry</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I wasn’t always like this, you see. It was Saturday October 18th,1983 I was sipping my cup of tea but then, suddenly. I woke up with my eyes blurred by a bright light. I lost my memory. All I could remember was the cold mercy water, tickling my feet. I traveled down south to a village. They took me in as one of them. There I met a friend more valuable than 2000 sapphires. His name was O’connor. He was a hunter, a talented one in fact he could shoot a target a mile away. As I still knew nothing about my life he took me under his wing. Six years later and I still had no memory but It didn't matter. I made a friend for life but on my thirteenth birthday it all came crashing down. I was hunting a herd of bison with O'Connor when I heard shots in the distance. We went to see what was going on. It turns out that our village was being attacked by soldiers. But by the time we got there everyone was dead. We were soon cornered by them but out of nowhere a bullet came hurdling for my heart. But O'connor jumped at me, taking the bullet with him. The body fell on me cracking my chest but it didn’t matter. I was so frustrated I didn’t notice the blood of my fallen comrade was being my new source of life. I bursted out with anger as my fuel. Turning the blood into the blood hungry gun with each kill gaining more power. I used the power to seek vengeance, I killed everyone. But eventually I got lonely with no one even touching me without dying. I traveled the lands once again this time searching for a worthy opponent. I eventually found a  new friend in the mountains. She was faster than light itself. She was cursed like me to have power but to be forever lonely. We set out to find others like us. </h5>

      <h1>Dead brother</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">A man is dead on a deserted Island wearing a backpack. The rescuers investigate the cause of death. They look inside the pack and find what killed him. What is inside the pack that killed him? A question on the paper. That brings back memories to my life on the streets.The time my parents died in the explosion leaving me to care for my brother. One day I was just thinking how to get my next meal when suddenly a guy running past me drops a stack of cash while being chased by two guys. Seven year old me thinking that I hit the jackpot bought food for me and my brother and enrolled him to school. Fast forward one month I slept in and he found the money while I was sleeping so he took it to school and he showed it to the teacher and just like that a full investigation happened they checked our backgrounds the police were involved so we had to go in hiding. We manage to hide at venezuela for a couple of weeks. Until they tracked us down I was on a hit list for the money. One day someone put a timed bomb in my backpack I didn’t relize until it was to late  I heard the sounds of sirens in the distance. I gave the kid my backpack with the money I told him to run then the backpack exploded leaving his lifeless body in one million pieces before my eyes. The cops came soon after they took me for questioning. One of them had pity on me so that was the day I got adopted and lost my brother.  </h5>
